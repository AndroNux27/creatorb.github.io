Ini Translator is a tool to quickly translate ini-type formatted files in different languages. <br>
Any file that stores data in the form <code>key = value</code> is suitable for use with this tool.<br>
It works by using a hidden Google Translate window for translation and so supports all the languages supported by it. <br>
<br>
Usage is pretty easy, download and unzip it and you are ready to use. It's a portable application which stores its settings in its own directory 
so no installtion is needed. <br>
Users can select multiple languages at a time to have their ini file translated in all the languages at once.<br>
You can also abandon certain words or phrases from being translated by listing them in the space provided. <br>
